Currently authentication is done with a fake timeout async action creator (submitUser). Async actions now work thanks to thunk middleware, though next step could be replacing thunk with a promise middleware as a way to handle it the Redux-way."

Application now make use of authentication state from both store and firebase. State is updated in userReducer and the submit component updates data according to state.

Login component does not know how to login, it just sends its form refs into the login handler function available via props. Its not possible to make login a functional presentational component since it contains refs. The logout component on the other hand should be as dumb as possible hence a presentational component."

A lot of lodgic remains in question of managing many cart orders including deletion of items from cart. refactor: 1. Attempt to make cart component slightly dumber, while cashier holds state and most of lodgic. 2. Created a Dish component used by cart, and will be used by others. Added some styles to cart component."

The chaining of map and reduce over the cart array is moved to a separate file were instead the map and reduce functions are composed and the result is returned to the cart component.

The switch statement is also in a function that is close to pure, the only reference from outside is the constants."
